Vripack Data Scraper

This PowerShell script will search at a local file server structure for useful information.
Once found, it will be added to a SQL database.
It will search inside these type of documents:

* DOCX
By extracting the XML file from the DOCX file, a plain text search is executed

* PDF
Using the [itextsharp.dll] module, PFD files are made searchable as plain text.
